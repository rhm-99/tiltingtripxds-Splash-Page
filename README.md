# IOC-Website
    Created by Rhiya Mehta
    
This was the website that I had learnt doing the Institute of Code 7-Day Coding Challenge. 
Although I have previously learnt a lot about CSS and HTML previously, doing this challenge not only allowed me to see what I could do but also improve on the skills that I already have.
