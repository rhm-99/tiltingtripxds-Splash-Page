# IOC-Website

This was the website that I had learnt doing the Institute of Code 7-Day Coding Challenge. 
Doing this challenge had allowed me to learn new things about HTML and CSS which I have never previously learnt before. It had also allowed me to refresh my memory in what I have previously learnt about CSS.
